I am a third year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of California, Irvine. 

My main research goal is to develop trustworthy computational methods to understand single-cell gene regulation, particularly in spatial contexts, and to translate these insights into applications for disease understanding and drug discovery. I am interested in causal inference and natural language processing.
